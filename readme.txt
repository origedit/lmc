use the command line to run the little man computer (lmc). here are the arguments:

lmc [-a source_file result_file] -b or -d]] [-r code_file]

-a stands for "assemble". keys -b and -d tell the assembler to write the lmc code either in binary -- a 16 bit wide word for an instruction -- or in decimal -- as a column of three-digit numbers. the lmc only runs binary files.

-r stands for "run".
